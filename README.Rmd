# bcsnowsbi

This package contains functions that calculate the snow basin index (SBI) value for a particular basin or basins within British Columbia, Canada. Snow basin index values are used by the BC River Forecast Centre within their monthly/bimonthly Snow Bulletin to decsribe how much snow is present within a specific area relative to typical conditions.

### Features
The package contains several functions for retrieving snow basin index values for a particlar basin within the province (details below).

This package also depends on two snow-specific packages to function: 
1. bcsnowdata() - retrieves raw data from both automated and manual snow survey sites. This package also contains functions to determine

2. bcsnowstats() - This function calculates statistics for specific sites that are used within the SBI calculation (specifically, percentiles as well as normals for the period of interest). Note that the sbi functions within the bcsnowsbi() package will automatically assign the appropriate normal time period based on the water year of the survey period you are looking for SBI values for (more detail in Useage section of this document).

### Installation
bcsnowsbi() can be installed directly from github.



### Usage

#### How SBI Values are Calculated for BS Basins

Snow basin indices are calculated for subbasins across British Columbia during the snow accumulation and melt season. They are a means of determining how much snow is within a basin relative to normal conditions for that basin for that time of year.

SBI values are calculated as:

#### Ways of Returning SBI Values Using bcsnowsbi()


There are several ways to return SBI values for a particular basin using bcsnowsbi().

Firstly, SBI values can be calculated and returned using the sbi_bybasin_function(). This allows the user to return SBI values for one, several, or all basins within BC. 



```{r sbi_bybasin_function}
## Example of how to use the sbi_bybasin_function()
# Retrieve SBI values for the Okanagan for Feb 1st, 2021
# No sites that should be removed from analysis ("exceptions"), or incorrect manual sites

library(bcsnowsbi)

SBI_2021 <- sbi_bybasin_function(get_year = "2021", # water year of survey period you want to retrieve
                                survey_period_i = c("02-01"),
                                all_basins = "Okanagan", # What basin to analyze SBI values for. Can also be "Yes" to get all SBI values for all basins
                                exceptions = c(), # No sites to remove from analysis
                                incorrect_sites = c(), incorrect_data = c(), # No incorrect manual sites. Otherwise, can specify the site name and data that a manual site should be (in cases where it data was incorrectly entered).
                                save_csv = "Yes", # Do you want to save 
                                path = "C:/Users/AJOLLYMO/RProjects/SnowData_archive/SBI_cache", # Path where you want to save a csv version of the results
                                force = TRUE, # Force re-analysis of data rather than getting data from cache
                                ask = FALSE) # whether to ask the user if they want to create a cache directory (thus, do so automatically)

```


#### Additional Analyis Details 

The bcsnowsbi() package uses the bcsnowstats() package in order to calculate statistics from raw data retrieved by bcsnowdata(). 

Most critically, bcsnowsbi() uses SWE normals calculated through bcsnowsbi(); these snow normals are values of mean SWE taken over a defined 30-year period for each calendar day (more detail about snow normal calculations is present within documentation for the bcsnowstats() package). This package will first define what this normal period should be depending on the  year of the date that the user wishes to calculate SBI values for. For example, if SBI values for January 1st, 2021 are calculated, a normal period of 1990-2020 will be automatically assigned (normals are then calculated through the bcsnowstats() function).
